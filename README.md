# 🛡️ Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Banking Transactions

This project, initiated by **Adey Innovations Inc.**, aims to **improve the detection of fraud cases** in e-commerce and bank transactions using advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques. By enhancing transaction security, we strive to reduce financial loss and foster trust among customers and financial institutions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The core objective of this project is to:

> **Build a robust, interpretable, and efficient fraud detection pipeline** using machine learning models and advanced feature engineering techniques for transactional datasets.

---

## 🚀 Key Goals

- **🔍 Accurate Fraud Detection**  
  Build machine learning models capable of effectively identifying fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.

- **🧠 Feature Engineering**  
  Derive informative features such as:
  - Time-based metrics (e.g., `time_since_signup`)
  - Geolocation-based features by mapping IP addresses to countries

- **⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling**  
  Address imbalanced data challenges using techniques like:
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  - Random Undersampling

- **📈 Model Development & Evaluation**  
  Train and evaluate models using metrics suited for imbalanced classification:
  - Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
  - Metrics: F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR

- **🧾 Model Interpretability**  
  Use SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) to explain predictions and identify key fraud indicators.

- **⏱️ Real-Time Monitoring Foundation**  
  Lay the groundwork for integrating real-time fraud detection capabilities into production environments.

## 💼 Business Impact

- **🔐 Improved Security**  
  Reduces financial loss by accurately flagging fraudulent activity.

- **👍 Enhanced User Experience**  
  Minimizes false positives, ensuring legitimate users are not mistakenly blocked.

- **✅ Trust & Compliance**  
  Promotes transparency, helps meet regulatory requirements, and builds customer trust.
